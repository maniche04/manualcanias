As explained here, a inventory movement in Canias is always linked to the source document which could be purchase, sales, transfer orders, etc. This filter option allows the user to narrow down the inventory listings to movements that were generated from a specific source document. Typically the following options are selected from the dropdown.

* **Purchase Order** - Upon selection of this option, three new input fields are presented. The inventory movements can then be narrowed down to a particular purchase order type, purchase order number or the delivery number.
